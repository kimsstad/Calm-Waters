<h2>Where you’ll be</h2>
<p><strong>Plettenberg Bay, Western Cape, South Africa</strong></p>

<p>
  The Place to Stay is ideally located in a vibrant, walkable neighborhood in the heart of
  Plettenberg Bay, just a short stroll from Central Beach, Beacon Isle Hotel, and the
  ever-popular River Club area. The apartment is conveniently situated just above a pharmacy,
  making it easy to grab any essentials you might need during your stay.
</p>

<p>
  Off to the side, you’ll find a SPAR supermarket and the SPAR Liquor Store, perfect for
  stocking up on groceries or beach picnic supplies. Next door is the well-loved Surf Café,
  a local hotspot for casual meals, drinks, and live music, with more restaurants tucked
  below for even more dining options.
</p>

<p>
  This area has a lively, friendly vibe, especially in peak holiday season, with a great mix
  of cafés, eateries, and shops all within easy walking distance. The nearby roundabout makes
  beach access simple — you’re about a 12–15 minute walk to the sand, where you can relax,
  swim, or watch the dolphins and whales that frequent the bay.
</p>

<p>
  Whether you’re after beach days, laid-back dining, or browsing local stores, everything is
  right on your doorstep — no car needed to soak up the best of Plett’s coastal charm!
</p>

<h3>Getting around</h3>
<p>
  One of the best things about staying in this apartment is that you really don’t need a car to
  enjoy the area — most restaurants, shops, cafés, and beaches are within easy walking
  distance. The neighborhood is very pedestrian-friendly, with the beach about a 12–15 minute
  walk away, and plenty to see and do along the way.
</p>

<p>
  If you’d like to explore further afield, local taxi services and nearby car hire companies
  like Avis at the Beacon Island Hotel (just 800&nbsp;m away) make it easy to plan day trips
  along the Garden Route.
</p>

<p>
  Parking: Free street parking options are available with 24-hour security patrolling the
  area, so you can park, unpack, and start exploring on foot.
